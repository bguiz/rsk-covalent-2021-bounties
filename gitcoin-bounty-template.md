- Only one submission allowed per participant. Where a participant wishes to resubmit, update the original submission instead of submitting a separate entry.
- If the submission involves a graphical user interface of any variety, please include a video recording of it in action along with your submission.
- If the submission involves a command line interface of any variety, please include a text file of it in action (including both inputs and outputs).
- If the submission involves separate code repositories, please indicate this is the case, and include links to them. These other code repositories should also meet the submission requirements.
- Test coverage for any implementation is viewed favourably: More test coverage is better.
- In cases where the bounty requires a change made to an existing code repository, and that code repository has continuous integration (CI) set up, the change should not fail on the CI steps.
- Documentation is viewed favourably: Include specific instructions on how to set up and use your submission. Optionally, include any explanations of architectural/ design choices that went into the submission.


Overall, the easier it is for the reviewer to run and understand the submission, the better, so be sure to consider this in your submissions!
